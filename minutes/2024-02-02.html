<h3>Webtoons' proposal (PR #2602)</h3>
<section><p id=x010 class=irc><cite>&lt;tzviya&gt;</cite> Date: 2024-02-02</p>
<p id=x015 class=irc><cite>&lt;shiestyle&gt;</cite> <a href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pull/2602">w3c/<wbr>epub-specs#2602</a></p>
<p id=x024 class="phone s01"><cite>Shinya:</cite> We have a PR<br>
<span id=x025>… can someone explain the PR?</span></p>
<p id=x029 class="phone s02"><cite>wendy:</cite> we both change the EPUB core and EPUB RS documents, in both documents we creating a new heading for telling that renditions flow metadata apply to both FXL and reflowable EPUB<br>
<span id=x030>… we also created diagrams to explain the behaviour we expect when rendition flow is applied</span><br>
<span id=x031>… we also change a MUST to a MAIN when we say about RSs that may ignore renditions flow</span></p>
<p id=x036 class="phone s03"><cite>ivan:</cite> is it correct that this change reflexts what is happening with webtoons?<br>
<span id=x037>… are we documenting existing practices?</span></p>
<p id=x042 class="phone s04"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> It depends: we're using rendition-flow = continuos, Apple is using it in their apps</p>
<p id=x043 class="phone s05"><cite>gpellegrino:</cite> did we discuss it at last two TPACs? Didn't we agree to move to the CG for experimenting?</p>
<p id=x046 class="phone s03"><cite>ivan:</cite> We the last WG there was not enough time, I don't remember with CG</p>
<p id=x047 class=summary>CG*</p>
<p id=x048 class="phone s06"><cite>dhall:</cite> Yes, we are using it in FXLs EPUBs</p>
<p id=x059 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> I think it really depends on what we agree it is a webtoon<br>
<span id=x060>… the division is not structurale, the vertical image is split just for distribution</span><br>
<span id=x061>… this helps also for optimization in loading</span><br>
<span id=x062>… this content is consumed in specialized platforms outside the generic EPUB ecosystem</span><br>
<span id=x063>… I think that instead of discussing about webtoons, we're misusing an existing property</span><br>
<span id=x064>… that may hurt other use cases, I think there is place for a broader discussion</span></p>
<p id=x065 class="phone s08"><cite>duga:</cite> about optimization: you can scroll the images natively, instead of using images in HTML</p>
<p id=x066 class="phone s04"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> In Japan many publishers are using EPUB as an interchange format, more then for a B2C format</p>
<p id=x067 class="phone s03"><cite>ivan:</cite> I'm trying to remember how it started: Japan publishers where worried of having a new big market (webtoons) outside the EPUB ecosystem</p>
<p id=x073 class="phone s02"><cite>wendy:</cite> I discussed with Hadrien offline, I think his comments are valid, at the same time I think we have to respond to this emerging market<br>
<span id=x074>… for the comment about the &quot;logistic&quot; (series, episodes, etc.) I think this is a metadata issue</span></p>
<p id=x077 class=irc><cite>&lt;Zakim&gt;</cite> tzviya, you wanted to add to Hadrien</p>
<p id=x079 class="phone s09"><cite>tzviya:</cite> I'm feeling like I felt when FXL came out<br>
<span id=x080>… we had an implementer who implemented it in a way and we adapted the format in that way</span></p>
<p id=x083 class="phone s06"><cite>dhall:</cite> content specification for a true webtoon may be more performant<br>
<span id=x084>… I would split this PR from &quot;webtoons&quot;, this is about how FXLs should be displayed with rendition-flow: continuos</span></p>
<p id=x089 class="phone s08"><cite>duga:</cite> we raised this issue two years ago and suggested to move it to the CG<br>
<span id=x090>… we should have done it two years ago</span><br>
<span id=x091>… I think also that webtoons is a trademark and we should not use it</span></p>
<p id=x102 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> to respond to David, no one asked for continuos scrolling outside of webtoons<br>
<span id=x103>… continuos scrolling is difficult to get with EPUBs, and even more with EPUB FXLs</span><br>
<span id=x104>… what I see that happen around the world is to tweak the format for doing things that are outside of the standard</span><br>
<span id=x105>… I don't think that hacking something is a good approch</span><br>
<span id=x106>… I think is better just to say &quot;this is a webtoon&quot;</span><br>
<span id=x107>… and manage that publication in a specific way</span><br>
<span id=x108>… instead of tweaking a metadata that was intended for other stuff</span></p>
<p id=x112 class="phone s04"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> In Japan we what to find a simple way to make comics in EPUBs<br>
<span id=x113>… we want to separate this PR with minor changes to the spec</span></p>
<p id=x116 class="phone s02"><cite>wendy:</cite> I think it is important to speak with Amazon (Kindle) on this<br>
<span id=x117>… to understand if this solution is good enough</span></p>
<p id=x121 class="phone s03"><cite>ivan:</cite> Hadrien propose to add a new metadata to say that the publication is a &quot;webtoon&quot;</p>
<p id=x122 class="phone s04"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> actually we already have special metadata for webtoons</p>
<p id=x128 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> in Japan there are a lot of profiles<br>
<span id=x129>… with XML prefixes to add information</span><br>
<span id=x130>… personally I don't think it is the way to move to metadata</span><br>
<span id=x131>… we have metadata conformsTo metadata (used for accessibility), we may use it for telling the publication conforms to webtoon</span><br>
<span id=x132>… it doesn't break anything</span></p>
<p id=x138 class="phone s05"><cite>gpellegrino:</cite> for adding metadata to EPUB is not required to change the specs, you can use the meta tag<br>
<span id=x139>… other comment about process, I think is better to move trough the CG, as we're doing for accessible FXL</span></p>
<p id=x142 class="phone s08"><cite>duga:</cite> I don't like the conformsTo approach, in any cases we need a spec to say what to do, in both cases we'll end up with RSs that will display broken webtoons</p>
<p id=x146 class="phone s09"><cite>tzviya:</cite> I agree with Brady, if we have to create a new profile, we don't have the charter to do this, we can only maintain the spec that is already published<br>
<span id=x147>… I think we should have everything in the main spec</span></p>
<p id=x151 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> to respond to Brady, I think that implementing vertical scroll is very expensive, specialized RSs are extracting images from the HTML and display them in canvas or similar<br>
<span id=x152>… no matter what we do, it will be broken in most of reading systems</span><br>
<span id=x153>… or we may suggest them a simpler way to ingest the EPUB and display only images</span></p>
<p id=x158 class="phone s04"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> I understand the performance issue, I think we should separate this discussion from the PR and wait for the Amazon comment</p>
<p id=x159 class="phone s03"><cite>ivan:</cite> Hadrien, do you think the additional metadata is in addition to the PR?</p>
<p id=x160 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> no, it is instead of the PR</p>
<p id=x163 class=irc><cite>&lt;tzviya&gt;</cite> +1 to wendy</p>
<p id=x166 class="phone s02"><cite>wendy:</cite> I understand Hadrien's point, a new metadata may lead to exotic values<br>
<span id=x167>… where publisher expect some type of rendition</span></p>
<p id=x174 class="phone s03"><cite>ivan:</cite> I think for the moment we'll not merge the PR<br>
<span id=x175>… in the meantime I think we may work on test cases</span><br>
<span id=x176>… and implementations, to be sure that it is feasible</span></p>
<p id=x178 class="phone s06"><cite>dhall:</cite> does the PR specify a MUST or MAY conformance?</p>
<p id=x181 class="phone s02"><cite>wendy:</cite> a MAY, before that rendition-flows was not available for reflowable<br>
<span id=x182>… not you can use that value for fixed layout</span></p>
<p id=x185 class="phone s06"><cite>dhall:</cite> so a RS that does not support webtoons will display the publication in separated pages</p>
<p id=x189 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> In Japan there are already different profiles that create stuff on top of EPUBs<br>
<span id=x190>… I think we should look at them</span><br>
<span id=x191>… at the same time I think webtoons are quite different from the other type of publications, and requires some extra research</span></p>
<p id=x193 class=irc><cite>&lt;Zakim&gt;</cite> tzviya, you wanted to remind about dictionaries</p>
<p id=x196 class="phone s06"><cite>dhall:</cite> I think we are not in line with the semantic of the content... webtoons are different from web comics<br>
<span id=x197>… so having a demo may be useful</span></p>
<p id=x198 class="phone s02"><cite>wendy:</cite> I'll make a video</p>
<p id=x199 class="phone s04"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> I'll contact Amazon for partecipating to the next meeting</p>
