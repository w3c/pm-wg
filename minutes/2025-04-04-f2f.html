<h3 id=0695>Footnotes, Extended Descriptions</h3>
<p id=000a class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> We need a better name for this, but we will discuss footnotes/extended descriptions</p>
<p id=e47d class="phone s04"><cite>gpellegrino:</cite> Last time we proposed to have a longer list of elements<br>
<span id=d284>… there are several</span><br>
<span id=4083>… many are for publisher guidance, but no impact on RS implementation</span><br>
<span id=10f9>… so those are out of scope</span><br>
<span id=30e6>… but some need both</span><br>
<span id=7cef>… one is cover, or perhaps fit-width images generally</span><br>
<span id=9bf8>… commercial pages is another (may need to ensure it is shown in samples)</span><br>
<span id=3440>… then poetry</span><br>
<span id=f7fc>… and linear/non-linear items</span><br>
<span id=1ee2>… and finally css page break property</span></p>
<p id=e897 class=irc><cite>&lt;sue-neu&gt;</cite> +1</p>
<p id=f614 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> I want to understand, for instance the page-break property - there is a spec<br>
<span id=a186>… linear/non-linear</span><br>
<span id=8bfc>… what else do we need to say?</span><br>
<span id=633f>… and which spec? a11y? rs?</span></p>
<p id=bc63 class="phone s05"><cite>duga:</cite> I think the problem in CSS page-break<br>
<span id=51cf>… is that its challenging, it was almost removed until we asked them not to</span><br>
<span id=8d6f>… the spec is very vague, easy to do nothing and be compliant</span><br>
<span id=6a75>… &quot;avoid&quot; is flimsy, elements it applies to is strange, only to block-level elements, its hard to tell what to do</span><br>
<span id=8d3d>… it's left up to the implementer</span><br>
<span id=0b4c>… and what happens in the reader, especially in scrolling contexts</span><br>
<span id=c35e>… linear/non-linear is intentionally vague</span></p>
<p id=ea01 class="phone s04"><cite>gpellegrino:</cite> I think this all at a level of guidance and notes<br>
<span id=8c0e>… but having guidance is useful</span><br>
<span id=d8d5>… We have guidance like this in DAISY knwledge base, but only for authors</span></p>
<p id=98f6 class="phone s03"><cite>George:</cite> Add endnotes to the list<br>
<span id=5357>… We find they are supported when in the file, not when in another file</span></p>
<p id=d325 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> Page break is one that I noted as important. I also added dpub aria and RS behavior (e.g. how to use it in RS)</p>
<p id=8c47 class="phone s06"><cite>Avneesh:</cite> DAISY board approved a RS requirements group under DAISY<br>
<span id=466b>… we are defining all these things under that group</span><br>
<span id=7df0>… It is a little beyond mainstream, since it is a11y focused</span></p>
<p id=93aa class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> Back to page breaks, historically we had specialized properties<br>
<span id=f0d6>… One problem we have is that we don't really use CSS page break model</span><br>
<span id=609d>… so this doesn't integrate well</span><br>
<span id=7dab>… we had this because there was a point in time where we had specialized renderers, but that is no longer true</span><br>
<span id=318e>… I see the use case, but there is a disconnect between this and reading system behavior</span></p>
<p id=c80a class="phone s08"><cite>sue-neu:</cite> The page break property, I work on books for younger readers<br>
<span id=02c3>… Sometimes I need an image and text together</span><br>
<span id=7e72>… so I need a way to keep things grouped</span><br>
<span id=8c45>… so I would love to keep that together</span></p>
<p id=9513 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> I would like to understand where we are going<br>
<span id=bc2b>… endnotes, footnotes, they are all problematic</span><br>
<span id=c182>… There are guideline for authors and RS, but I have no idea what we would have to change in the specs</span><br>
<span id=3473>… So if we go down guidelines, then the DAISY work makes more sense. If they are doing it we should cooperate with them to avoid duplication of labor</span><br>
<span id=004b>… But first we have to decide what we want</span></p>
<p id=387f class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> The question we have is where to do this (spec or elswhere)<br>
<span id=0363>… and the answer seems to be somewhere else</span><br>
<span id=196d>… This feels more like a techniques document</span><br>
<span id=d298>… One thing we can and should include is a test suite</span><br>
<span id=fc26>… So we you can check for support in RSes</span></p>
<p id=a5dc class="phone s04"><cite>gpellegrino:</cite> I agree<br>
<span id=9af9>… to reply to Ivan, it is a little different in pub than web</span><br>
<span id=951a>… In web you can control the UX</span><br>
<span id=60d0>… in epub, there isn't really JS support and more things are declarative</span><br>
<span id=1d38>… we rely on RS to display the content</span><br>
<span id=0fae>… so we should agree among the parties on how to display this</span><br>
<span id=f548>… for instance we gave guidance to Adobe on how to handle certain things</span><br>
<span id=77f3>… And they asked if this was correct or not, we said to just trust us. It worked out</span></p>
<p id=15dc class="phone s03"><cite>George:</cite> There is a relationship between the RS and the content where if you can depend on the way a RS will work<br>
<span id=4ffb>… So right now we use backlinks from endnotes, but there are other types of links</span><br>
<span id=09b2>… And some RS can handle go back from them, but we are putting in backlinks which is bad. It would be better if we could depend on the RS to maintain a backstack</span></p>
<p id=ffff class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> I think it is a tricky topic, existing implementation can guide us<br>
<span id=6abe>… for instance lack of footnote use not being used in Japan is a big deal</span><br>
<span id=b1af>… and needs to be fixed</span><br>
<span id=175f>… The RSes need to fix this</span><br>
<span id=198e>… There are some things we can do in readium and thorium</span><br>
<span id=980b>… for instance, we will handle endnotes that are in another document</span><br>
<span id=10000>… Go back is good, but popup footnotes are useful</span><br>
<span id=ff9d>… But they tend to be in plain text</span><br>
<span id=f622>… it would be nice to use some other affordance like a sidebar that properly display the styled html</span><br>
<span id=e51e>… But this should be a pref</span><br>
<span id=90b8>… We can never be one size fits all for this, so we will probably do all three</span><br>
<span id=04a3>… of course this only applies to us and anyone that uses us</span><br>
<span id=6395>… It is hard to see how the wg addresses this</span></p>
<p id=f73f class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> So I stubbornly come back to procedural side<br>
<span id=8a8d>… I see 2 docs, guidelines for authors, and another for RSes</span><br>
<span id=7f30>… in both cases, adding test cases and adding it to our test suite is a great idea</span><br>
<span id=081e>… but this is significant work</span><br>
<span id=9152>… So if we pass this as a resolution we need to assign editors and people who will lead the effort</span><br>
<span id=cd43>… this can't go to me and Matt</span><br>
<span id=45b1>… if we can't find someone to do that then we should close the issue</span></p>
<p id=4039 class="phone s08"><cite>sue-neu:</cite> To build on that, we should also consider that this is not a document we can do one and done. It will need to be updated as we go along</p>
<p id=c867 class="phone s09"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> Popup foot notes are hardly used in Japan, but if have long text for a11y we have to find a way to do this (e.g. extended desc for imaages)<br>
<span id=4c36>… If it is easy to find a suitable approach it is fine in Japan</span></p>
<p id=3c5d class="phone s05"><cite>duga:</cite> Footnotes, there is some real guidance we need to give to handle it properly, it's very inconsistent right now, it's helpful to have authoring guidance<br>
<span id=e063>… you need to guess what happens when you encounter a link</span><br>
<span id=5559>… the sidebar idea, what if multiple footnotes, can you show them all</span></p>
<p id=5542 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> we do need people to work in this<br>
<span id=e28d>… it is also really important, so it is hard to accept that we might not have someone to do this</span><br>
<span id=b59a>… And to what sue-neu said, things don't change too fast</span><br>
<span id=b6d0>… so the more confidence you have that something is a link to a footnote, the better</span></p>
<p id=75d4 class="phone s03"><cite>George:</cite> One of the other things that looks like a footnote but isn't, is an annotation<br>
<span id=025f>… specifically author provided annotations</span><br>
<span id=6cef>… Do we ignore this and just call it a footnote?</span><br>
<span id=31d9>… for instance the anmoted Alice</span></p>
<p id=88fd class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> There is also the affordance for tap or double tap interact with an image<br>
<span id=811c>… and another is tables</span><br>
<span id=751b>… image is often implemented, but there is a lot to explore (e.g. extended desc)</span><br>
<span id=16d6>… But tables is a big one and why people really like PDF</span><br>
<span id=d461>… It would be really nice to have a good implementation</span></p>
<p id=aef1 class="phone s06"><cite>Avneesh:</cite> On to the work management side, one thing the a11y TF can do is create an index for these topics<br>
<span id=918d>… Since it is all the same people who are also working on the knowledge base</span><br>
<span id=10001>… so a11y TF can at least take that up</span></p>
<p id=672f class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> That is a good first step. Maybe we can take that info and go from there<br>
<span id=85d8>… anything else we want to include or are missing?</span></p>
<p id=7358 class="phone s03"><cite>George:</cite> Do these impact dpub aria? do we need new roles?</p>
<p id=3105 class="phone s06"><cite>Avneesh:</cite> Yes, and this will help us identify it</p>
<p id=0738 class="phone s03"><cite>George:</cite> Some question about JAWS and NVDA and how it interacts and fits into the RS side of things</p>
<p id=e827 class="phone s06"><cite>Avneesh:</cite> Those are things that are going on and will continue to<br>
<span id=9dea>… This is where the index will guide what we are working</span><br>
<span id=c290>… on. It is hard to create a plan at this stage</span><br>
<span id=b32d>… There is ongoing work that will go on for 5 or 10 years</span></p>
<p id=b9b3 class="phone s03"><cite>George:</cite> We have core media types, do we have the same concepts for behaviors?</p>
<p id=c8a0 class="phone s10"><cite>all:</cite> no</p>
<p id=55ac class="phone s11"><cite>CharlesL:</cite> Back when the diagram center was around, someone from Norton created a plug in that would, for images, grab info (extended desc, etc)<br>
<span id=a825>… So when you hover you would get info</span><br>
<span id=b231>… he made an API for that, I am not sure what happened to that work</span><br>
<span id=3ea5>… this might be similar to what Hadrien mentioned</span></p>
<p id=fb10 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> It is very similar<br>
<span id=169a>… I was thinking a view where you could interact with the image along with desc</span></p>
<p id=292e class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> so the general concept is the RS would have affordances over fragments of the doc<br>
<span id=1a79>… but it is hard if you also have JS</span><br>
<span id=4db7>… so really hard with fixed layout with JS</span><br>
<span id=7e78>… so if there is JS, we will probably disable them</span><br>
<span id=c6cf>… except maybe side panel or something like that</span></p>
<p id=0057 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> I don't know if the presentation we just saw from CharlesL was JS based</p>
<p id=e193 class="phone s06"><cite>Avneesh:</cite> Yes it was</p>
<p id=b31f class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> We said we need to go to html, I have the feeling that the aversion to JS can't last for long<br>
<span id=1876>… so I know it is allowed, but we also say don't do it</span><br>
<span id=29ea>… I don't think long term that is an option</span><br>
<span id=0b7f>… I think we need some ways to do this programmatically</span><br>
<span id=3149>… That tendancy is there and people will be less and less interested in declarative</span><br>
<span id=b7a2>… so we need to allow it on the RS saide</span></p>
<p id=a37e class="phone s03"><cite>George:</cite> There is a lot going on with visualizations so I kind of agree with Ivan<br>
<span id=5adc>… Also being able to hold things together might be a thing for dpub aria</span></p>
<p id=1b10 class="phone s05"><cite>duga:</cite> You can do that with page-break: avoid<br>
<span id=7bc3>… page break is not a great way of doing anything</span><br>
<span id=fad2>… it's remarkably expensive to get that info from the DOM</span><br>
<span id=a577>… I had a regex to check if page-break was used in a file, when its present it has a cost to rendering</span><br>
<span id=8d51>… to Ivan's side, we had a spec for that</span><br>
<span id=4bc9>… what if you wanted to do interesting data viz in reflow, widgets</span><br>
<span id=5d9e>… it was never used, no one wanted to figure out the widget spec</span><br>
<span id=ceb3>… my feeling is, you might be right, but then EPUB is dead, all publications are now web pages</span><br>
<span id=e07f>… the web is a development platform for applications, once EPUB readers become hosts for applications, it makes no sense, browsers are already very good at that</span><br>
<span id=a755>… I have no interest in recreating web browsers</span><br>
<span id=351d>… publishers don't want to write applications</span><br>
<span id=863b>… if you want advanced things, do it on the web, but for straightforward content, use EPUB</span></p>
<p id=5def class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> I wanted to say more on that<br>
<span id=5ee8>… I hve had to deal with epub files, where each file was a react app</span><br>
<span id=4151>… so I know what it takes to do that</span><br>
<span id=0eba>… I think there is some value in consistency in affordances</span><br>
<span id=497d>… that might not be available otherwise</span><br>
<span id=bc86>… there is also desire to do your own thing that won't be a problem</span><br>
<span id=d335>… The way we handled this with fixed layout and JS was to do as little as possible</span><br>
<span id=b96c>… So you are left with the spine and toc, and that's about it</span><br>
<span id=af1f>… we could do that for reflow</span><br>
<span id=cdbf>… we would drop pagination</span><br>
<span id=0bc9>… and maybe add some affordances</span><br>
<span id=4483>… some thing would be hard</span><br>
<span id=ac3a>… bookmarks maybe but annotations are hard</span><br>
<span id=d295>… so we may have to do that</span><br>
<span id=16b9>… The people who want to do that don't like containers</span><br>
<span id=f2e0>… So remote resources come up and are problematic</span><br>
<span id=489b>… it is intersesting to explore</span><br>
<span id=2b9c>… there are some things you gain, some you lose</span><br>
<span id=b59c>… I am not sure if users will be happy with lack of consistency</span></p>
<p id=ae45 class="phone s08"><cite>sue-neu:</cite> I agree with ivan that one reason we don't pull in younger people is lack of scripting<br>
<span id=7265>… But I really hate the idea that epub is dead, as we have a lot of them</span></p>
<p id=3b97 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> next steps, a11y TF will create an index</p>

<section>
<h3 id=c5da>Dark Mode</h3>
<p id=848f class="phone s05"><cite>duga:</cite> [shares screen]<br>
<span id=b28b>… I noticed this a while ago when we implemented dark mode in the specs</span><br>
<span id=8233>… the web has caught on to the fact that people like to read in different colour modes</span><br>
<span id=791f>… we've had it in ebooks for 30+ years</span><br>
<span id=f4c1>… the web has caught up!</span><br>
<span id=4766>… reading systems often have 2+ modes</span><br>
<span id=08fb>… this interacts oddly with the platform you are on</span><br>
<span id=c765>… if your platform is on dark mode, you may not want to read that way, the RS will override</span><br>
<span id=7162>… CSS has this cool way of making the web page adapt to the mode of the device</span><br>
<span id=8f78>… [sample on screen]</span><br>
<span id=6d3d>… you can specify different CSS for light mode or dark mode</span><br>
<span id=71b6>… RS do strange things to make colours work</span><br>
<span id=410e>… Play books has light, dark, sepia, and nightlight, this is mapped to different activities</span><br>
<span id=2a8b>… depends on the device, on Android, the activity can be light or dark, and the web view will pick up the activity, similar on iOS, no idea what happens on windows</span><br>
<span id=6460>… since this is automatic, the webview is extracting these styles and implementing them</span><br>
<span id=3adf>… tried this sample on several platforms</span><br>
<span id=c9c2>… to see what would happen</span><br>
<span id=a2a6>… what happens is, if you are in anything other than light mode, these styles are ignored for colours, discarded, no issues</span><br>
<span id=ad43>… in light mode/neutral mode, they are ignored or follow the setting of the current view. The colours might get mixed, or the device overrides to dark mode.</span><br>
<span id=f385>… only affects light/neutral mode</span><br>
<span id=3d9b>… doesn't apply in dark mode</span><br>
<span id=2b89>… it's horribly inconsistent, no issues today but might be an issue in future, we might want to warn publishers</span></p>
<p id=97f8 class="phone s04"><cite>gpellegrino:</cite> EPUB is dead, the way RS managed this for years was problematic for a11y, if the content creator used colours, it would get messed up when the themes were added<br>
<span id=81a3>… colours would switch improperly, I'm not sure we should suggest not to use</span><br>
<span id=021e>… using media queries we can learn about specific colours or modes for a11y</span><br>
<span id=fdd7>… maybe we should require RS to use the browser method, and if the EPUB creator does not declare, the RS can apply their stylesheet</span><br>
<span id=66e9>… if the EPUB creator declares, the RS should listen</span></p>
<p id=7543 class="phone s05"><cite>duga:</cite> The problem with that, EPUB ecosystem is much richer than web, people have been reading long form contnet for a long time<br>
<span id=4ad5>… it's all over the place on different platforms</span></p>
<p id=f1c9 class="phone s04"><cite>gpellegrino:</cite> You can still offer sepia, if the EPUB creator provides dark or light, you should honour that</p>
<p id=dcb9 class="phone s05"><cite>duga:</cite> What about charcoal, Kobo has that + dark mode<br>
<span id=a76a>… Thorium doesn't have light, it has neutral</span><br>
<span id=a379>… CSS doesn't mandate names</span><br>
<span id=539e>… we could make a list</span><br>
<span id=5c20>… my reason for not going down that road, figuring out all the variations is challenging</span></p>
<p id=c0d2 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> I don't see how this could work<br>
<span id=0e67>… just assessing the presence of these things would be hell</span><br>
<span id=32fb>… the only place this could work is FXL</span><br>
<span id=6ead>… reflowable is &quot;whatever I want&quot;, many apps let you set all the colours</span><br>
<span id=0459>… I don't believe that author intent can be preserved in this</span><br>
<span id=c71a>… FXL is different because the relationship with RS and content is different</span><br>
<span id=d077>… only thing RS might do with FXL is spread layout or zooming</span><br>
<span id=434e>… doing this in FXL would be fine, but in reflow it opens a huge can of wor,s</span><br>
<span id=35c8>… incredibly difficult to implement without breaking expected behaviour</span></p>
<p id=c51b class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> I am more with Gregorio on this, if I am an author take the responsibility to use the CSS and declare colours,<br>
<span id=10002>… that is a request to the RS to hand off the settign</span><br>
<span id=a824>… I set up these things</span><br>
<span id=1eff>… that does not seem related to the FXL thing</span><br>
<span id=0348>… I don't see the problem with that</span></p>
<p id=5f80 class="phone s05"><cite>duga:</cite> You don't do UX for reading systems<br>
<span id=a86e>… RS implementors are horrified</span></p>
<p id=5dea class="phone s12"><cite>gautierchomel_:</cite> The question raised by Gregorio, and the accessibility part, we're not asking to have author style maintained in reflow<br>
<span id=f378>… the point is to provide a mode accessible RX in some modes, that some RS can't handle right now</span><br>
<span id=370e>… I agree with Ivan, if the EPUB creator makes a mistake, the responsibility falls to them, it should be used wisely</span><br>
<span id=c69a>… it's an accessibility problem</span><br>
<span id=5e45>… some content becomes unreadable when the colour is changed, but some experts know how</span></p>
<p id=4ab9 class="phone s05"><cite>duga:</cite> As a reader of books, I would argue you have no idea how I want to read<br>
<span id=e0d9>… you create light and dark mode, as a signal to the reading system, it's not trivial to detect but possible</span><br>
<span id=bbf5>… my device is in dark mode 100% of the time, and 100% of the time I read in light mode</span><br>
<span id=f7db>… in Ivan's scenario, the CSS would follow the system settings</span><br>
<span id=8a1f>… I need to then switch my system settings to light, to read in the way I want</span><br>
<span id=c6ea>… I will then find a reader that does not do this</span><br>
<span id=292b>… I will post a one-star review of the app I'm using, and use another potentially bad app</span></p>
<p id=b892 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> I see both sides<br>
<span id=18c6>… however as RS implementor and a11y person</span><br>
<span id=73e7>… I think it is terrible to move this to content creator</span><br>
<span id=b927>… as it pulls the ability away from me to do what I need to</span><br>
<span id=d607>… I think we have a real problem with styling for modes</span><br>
<span id=1943>… I think that is a real problem, but this isn't a solution to that</span><br>
<span id=4ff1>… publishers would have trouble doing this at scale</span><br>
<span id=ae18>… Publishers often don't test in all these environments</span><br>
<span id=f90d>… and the style sheets are so complex any attemptt to figure it out will break some other book</span><br>
<span id=e373>… I don't know the solution though</span></p>
<p id=10003 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> I completely agree with the two last people, if this were to happen, RSs would go nuclear<br>
<span id=dad5>… process files, remove all this, break things in the process</span><br>
<span id=47c7>… people will say your ebook reader is broken, platforms will need to get rid of this</span><br>
<span id=a6fe>… it doesn't deal with a problem at all</span><br>
<span id=dadc>… no issues with light mode, dark mode is challenging, and then we have the others</span><br>
<span id=840c>… reading systems doing their best to make colours work</span><br>
<span id=404d>… some RS let users select font and background-color</span><br>
<span id=9499>… solutions are likely more along those sides than authoring</span></p>
<p id=5b81 class="phone s11"><cite>CharlesL:</cite> This is how I envision how this might work<br>
<span id=9c58>… me as a user, I hate when I set my system into dark mode and the app I open is in light mode</span><br>
<span id=08cf>… what I would expect is for the RS to check my settings, go to the default, and if you change in the RX settings to another thing, that setting gets preserved</span><br>
<span id=d49c>… the other part where the author decided to do their own light-mode or dark mode, the RX could be intelligent enough to say there is an alternative, offer it within the settings</span><br>
<span id=140f>… let the user pick that mode as an option, instead of forcing it</span><br>
<span id=112c>… let them choose what the author has provided</span></p>
<p id=da07 class="phone s04"><cite>gpellegrino:</cite> I think that one approach may be similar to the one for font faces<br>
<span id=abaa>… the RS displays the fonts provided by the publishers, and offers other options</span><br>
<span id=60cc>… initial option to honour the publisher default, then switch to user settings</span></p>
<p id=d777 class="phone s12"><cite>gautierchomel_:</cite> I see the same solution as gpellegrino, before we had a lot of normalization of CSS, now we have customize text formatting<br>
<span id=a91f>… these principles could apply to this too</span><br>
<span id=5f9f>… to me it's not about the text/background, the issues are more when there are SVGs with transparent backgrounds, how can we set</span></p>
<p id=10004 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> My experience, I have played with drawings, combined with dark/light<br>
<span id=8490>… when I have a book I have had challenges with images, usually what happens is the image continues to be displayed on a white background, not pleasant</span><br>
<span id=b447>… it's difficult to set it up, there's tools that can produce SVGs with dark/light mode</span><br>
<span id=fc99>… with JPG I have no idea</span><br>
<span id=d3b9>… even there, the CSS which does the recommendation for images, it artificially sets the background to white, I explicitly say the background is neutral</span><br>
<span id=88d0>… I should be able to do it in EPUB</span><br>
<span id=745b>… in general, the approach is ignoring CSS color-scheme, I can't adapt my drawings to what is happening in the RS</span></p>
<p id=49ba class="phone s05"><cite>duga:</cite> Start with Charles, what you said is very logical, reasonable, unfortunately users are not logical or make perfect sense<br>
<span id=3705>… we've done this, we used to default to the system setting</span><br>
<span id=b583>… Android decided dark mode is awesome, so we followed system, system was now in dark mode, the usero pened the book and it was in dark mode, they were confused, not knowing that there are options</span><br>
<span id=9769>… many users don't use settings</span><br>
<span id=3617>… no idea they can switch colour mode, now you pop up a dialog box, ask them a question and give them a tutorial</span><br>
<span id=a04e>… they ignore the tutorial, they're mad at you, people think their books are broken</span><br>
<span id=d57f>… to Ivan's point, for images in SVG it's hard to do the right thing, there is logic to figure it out</span><br>
<span id=6682>… it would be great to figure that out</span><br>
<span id=9238>… as Wendy said, media queries isn't the solution</span><br>
<span id=900c>… for sepia, what do we do then?</span><br>
<span id=d5b7>… white on black, black on white?</span><br>
<span id=deb0>… ok so for this book I won't show sepia</span><br>
<span id=d8c8>… publishers follow suit, but now those books from that whole publisher can't be read in sepia</span><br>
<span id=7d96>… users are mad, they can't read how they want</span><br>
<span id=d03d>… as RS implementors, users are more important that what the publishers want</span><br>
<span id=71ed>… I do want an answer to this problem</span><br>
<span id=19c0>… there is a more complicated answer, this might be part.</span></p>
<p id=1c97 class="phone s09"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> Publishers don't want more cost</p>
<p id=2e6e class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> System defaults, I tried in the past, different themes for the app itself<br>
<span id=d22f>… not for reading</span><br>
<span id=d336>… when there is a big change in the app or OS</span><br>
<span id=b057>… you might want to preserve the default, changing stuff on behalf of users is the biggest issue</span><br>
<span id=7d6d>… some RS have options per book vs global options</span></p>
<p id=64a7 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> Browsers do this</p>
<p id=10005 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> I'd like to have something that works, it's not going to work with every single colour theme<br>
<span id=2ef2>… allow an interaction where it's an image, maybe let them open in another view, open the image on its own</span></p>
<p id=4f11 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> What if the image refers into the content?</p>
<p id=e65c class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> Lots of apps do nothing for bitmaps<br>
<span id=e3f4>… we've tried inversion and such</span><br>
<span id=e10a>… we leave the image as is, it's ugly, but not broken</span></p>

<h3 id=4582>Digital Comics (Technical Discussion)</h3>
<p id=69f5 class="phone s09"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> I would like to ear more opinions from the japanese industry on yesterday discussion.</p>
<p id=02f8 class="phone s09"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> for today let's talk about needs and ways to adress them.</p>
<p id=10006 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> the solution is probably in the middle of images in a zip vs epub completly. We need reading order, reading direction, metadata, cover, TOC and spread placement. Image map approach, visual TOC may be interesting too.</p>
<p id=0861 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> instead, some controls like orientation are probably ot a good idea, it should remain in power of users.</p>
<p id=17df class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> chapters, episodes, volumes, that's issues to deal with.</p>
<p id=037e class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> have we done a gap analysis on metadata? I mean more extended than only for comics. It could help. The more we can hand to the reading system, the more constraint we have in authoring but also the maore liberty we give to the RS and therefore the user.</p>
<p id=f172 class="phone s04"><cite>gpellegrino:</cite> I did and found several missing metadata, but the group decision was to not overload content becuase they are not used by RS. We decided to keep them in ONIX only</p>
<p id=d7ac class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> be carrefull to not reinvent the wheel. There is probably palces to find those metadatas defined somewhere. EPUB and publication manifest are flexible in that way. we don't define dc terms, we refer and use them.</p>
<p id=79ec class="phone s13"><cite>tzviya:</cite> it was 2017 i guess, with gregorio and matt, we created a poll to detremine what was actually really used. We probably don't have to do it again, things have not changed probably</p>
<p id=96de class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> schema.org has extension for comics, we could use it. But we also need to tell people how to use it. There are uses for archive, so we need to be able to use those metadatas in packages.</p>
<p id=f4e0 class="phone s09"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> in Japan some RS have two rendering engines aside, one for fixed and one for reflow. Webtoons are usually fixed.</p>
<p id=96fd class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> Kindle asks to identify comics, same in Japan. This is used to excract images out of XHTML files. It is used, we should explore and discuss further how to inform that in the file.</p>
<p id=bf4f class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> there are usecases where ONIX is not suficiently used or we can difficulty rely on it. I agree a file level metadata is stronger for content ingestion. Sometime in a same serie, the files are done very differently. It's fragile to work with what we actually have.</p>
<p id=fad5 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> other topic is spread position, sometime it is important to insurce understanding of the content. We see publishers who gives no information, expecting the first resource displayed on it's own that is not a spec define comportement. We should explore and define better the spread position spec. Maybe it is not only about comics and has to go to the wider group.</p>
<p id=ce67 class="phone s08"><cite>sue-neu:</cite> I agree it's a fixed layout wide problem, not only comics.</p>
<p id=1d5f class="phone s08"><cite>sue-neu:</cite> I have real life exemples to show.</p>
<p id=9f6e class="phone s08"><cite>sue-neu:</cite> we should dig into real life practices.</p>
<p id=cd54 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> Also we have the question about accessibility. I thik that fragment level is the place to adress that. We are missing hability to syncronise image fragments with something else, being text or audio, whatever. We have production exemple of capacity to automate a script for a page, but no real way to bring thta to end users now.</p>
<p id=f24b class="phone s05"><cite>duga:</cite> the cover placement is predictable; left right placement can end up a mess, we had to ignore publishers information in many cases; we spent time implementing bubble zoom, it was not really used, it was compatible with region based navigation. Might be an interesting starting point. It has been in the mind of EPUB since a long time.</p>

<p id=2d2f class=irc><cite>&lt;Makoto&gt;</cite> Even if we provide text for every rasterized text in manga, it will not be really accessible.  Manga is more complicated than that.</p>
<p id=fd65 class="phone s09"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> it is not today realistic for publishers to prepare textual version for a complete comics. It's a different version. Audiobook would better respond this need we think.</p>
<p id=ef74 class=irc><cite>&lt;sue-neu&gt;</cite> LINK preparing comics for Kindle <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/GJMRD9F78MS9F43R">https://<wbr>kdp.amazon.com/<wbr>en_US/<wbr>help/<wbr>topic/<wbr>GJMRD9F78MS9F43R</a></p>
<p id=cf3e class=irc><cite>&lt;Makoto&gt;</cite> Creating radio drama or novels from manga is a better approach for making manga accessible.</p>
<p id=3cda class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> it's true, for now it's too costly, but under marrakech treaty, organisations are doing adaptations, they start to move from Daisy to EPUB. They should be able to do this with that format.</p>
<p id=3eef class=irc><cite>&lt;sue-neu&gt;</cite> LINK Amazon aquires comixology and their tech <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2014/4/amazon-com-to-acquire-comixology">https://<wbr>press.aboutamazon.com/<wbr>2014/<wbr>4/<wbr>amazon-com-to-acquire-comixology</a></p>
<p id=6d0b class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> we need to think accessibility not only for blind users. We need more than just a textual alternative, to adress more needs. Region based navigation is the good idea, but is complex to implement today. Audio is not sufficient, but the amount of work involved in audio production could benefit to more users if it was mapped to fragments of images.</p>
<p id=61ea class="phone s04"><cite>gpellegrino:</cite> EU act states those contents &quot;should be made as accessible as possible to the state of the art&quot;</p>
<p id=c47a class="phone s08"><cite>sue-neu:</cite> using AI to author this way, we must consider possible copyright issues.</p>
<p id=7e36 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> there is space to incubate with specialised libraries which benefit of marrakech treaty..</p>
<p id=10007 class="phone s09"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> as a publisher it is hard to provide also good pronounciation for TTS. That's a reason why audiobook is prefered. Technologies evolves, we are happy to explore more paths today.</p>
<p id=6d41 class="phone s09"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> I'll be happy to discuss that further with Japanese publishers to draw a path.</p>
<p id=5ffe class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> on a practical level, i would like to have a more active participation from people, as PR, so we can discuss on concrete. The documents are big and I don't want to overload editor's work, we should focus on rewieving.</p>
<p id=dc4d class="phone s14"><cite>gautierchomel:</cite> Part of the discussion about incubation, which can happen in the CG<br>
<span id=7e07>… happy to open up a discussion there</span></p>

<h3 id=9f6f>FXL Accessibility</h3>
<p id=f6a4 class="phone s15"><cite>Wendy:</cite> the TF has been working on the techniques document<br>
<span id=24d6>… with specific models and examples</span></p>
<p id=10008 class="phone s15"><cite>Wendy:</cite> we don't need to discuss techniques until there is more work done<br>
<span id=b220>… we can discuss here some of the ideas being incubated</span><br>
<span id=4c66>… since right now we cannot make FXL accessibility fully conformant</span><br>
<span id=9ab2>… there are ways around this with new tech</span><br>
<span id=b222>… it would be better for us to be specific and clear about what we suggest</span><br>
<span id=b72d>… to avoid chaos on the rs side</span><br>
<span id=50c2>… especially in converting or mixing fxl and reflow content</span><br>
<span id=1c40>… there is a lack of implementation and clarity for RS</span></p>
<p id=10009 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> we are planning to implement that feature<br>
<span id=31b0>… our current plan aims for starting work between August and October</span><br>
<span id=77b1>… beginning with web first with side by side views</span><br>
<span id=dade>… and smaller views on mobile</span><br>
<span id=b352>… we need to identify fxl books where this will work well</span><br>
<span id=1b24>… we will offer this for all cases</span><br>
<span id=61aa>… if we are happy with the web implementation we will move on to other platforms</span></p>
<p id=c9db class="phone s04"><cite>gpellegrino:</cite> are you going to document the way this works for content creators?</p>
<p id=40c5 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> this is all open source<br>
<span id=f324>… there are two parts, how do we create reflowable view from existing content</span><br>
<span id=ff02>… and how do we create affordances</span></p>
<p id=230e class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> this work will be done before readaloud<br>
<span id=d243>… we will make a limited set of affordances that can grow in the future</span></p>
<p id=7334 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> we are writing the implementation document because of things that happen in text in fxl<br>
<span id=9796>… multiple spans, curved type</span><br>
<span id=e22f>… in the guidelines we ask that publishers not do these things</span><br>
<span id=5e7b>… it sounds easy to pull the text from fxl to reflow, but it is complex</span></p>
<p id=0e1e class="phone s14"><cite>gautierchomel:</cite> we will be doing the same  work as a screen reader is doing<br>
<span id=b439>… we will find things going forward that we will seek community feedback</span></p>

<p id=b718 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> for reflow a lot of it is breaking down content into utterances<br>
<span id=1b42>… I could have a sentance that starts of one html document and ends on another</span><br>
<span id=dd41>… we may have to go beyond existing boundaries</span><br>
<span id=0144>… we will be tempted to treat it like a giant blob of text and try to find sentences</span><br>
<span id=2c5e>… we might actually be able to detect text out of order using this method</span><br>
<span id=4487>… we don't care about some tags, like span</span><br>
<span id=3d04>… unless it is used to specify another language</span><br>
<span id=b7d2>… there will be a lot of things to consider</span></p>
<p id=8911 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> a big takeaway will be making a list of things not to do<br>
<span id=9c92>… we will learn what is catastrophic to get around</span><br>
<span id=cad9>… if you can solve reading order, accessibility companies would find this valuable</span><br>
<span id=2689>… it would be cool to have a reading order tool</span></p>
<p id=43ee class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> this would also be useful for language detection</p>
<p id=75da class="phone s16"><cite>CharlesL1:</cite> Benetech is working with Amazon publishing<br>
<span id=bc3a>… we have certified their publishing reflowable workflow</span><br>
<span id=ff18>… now we are working on their fxl workflow</span><br>
<span id=8aec>… we think it is possible to get to the 2A or AA</span></p>
<p id=3875 class="phone s17"><cite>marisa:</cite> Is there anywhere available of bad fxl?<br>
<span id=a767>… any examples we can share of what we are trying to fix</span></p>
<p id=e89e class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> we should look at our test cases</p>
<p id=35b3 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> those are too simple<br>
<span id=b627>… it is hard to see bad fxl, they usually look beautifu</span><br>
<span id=dc5d>… publishers don't like when we pull their content for this</span><br>
<span id=f889>… but we could probably recreate a file with common issues</span></p>
<p id=6aa5 class="phone s17"><cite>marisa:</cite> it would be really helpful</p>
<p id=429c class="phone s03"><cite>George:</cite> in Acrobat, they now have a reflow option<br>
<span id=213d>… duff johnson brought that to our attention</span><br>
<span id=3ef9>… but in epubtest.org we should be testing fxl layout and reading systems performance</span><br>
<span id=8674>… we have not engaged with this and have no test book yet</span><br>
<span id=c7fd>… we have been asked to explore this</span></p>
<p id=a713 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> it is tricky to check these books, in some cases because ai can detect and read text</p>
<p id=db43 class="phone s16"><cite>CharlesL1:</cite> a random selection of bookshare books came up with some examples of<br>
<span id=e20c>… blank html pages with full images specified in css</span><br>
<span id=2d84>… and with letters in random order</span></p>
<p id=d724 class="phone s18"><cite>Dale_R:</cite> the reading order issue, would the tab index attribute be a good answer?</p>

<p id=896f class="phone s18"><cite>Dale_R:</cite> if things are visually all over the page, it can be a challenge with the DOM</p>
<p id=0505 class="phone s03"><cite>George:</cite> if people follow our guidelines and techniques, and the RS can provide a good experience<br>
<span id=c8a2>… then could metadata be used by the publisher to make a claim about fxl accessibility?</span></p>

<span id=0188>… its not the book itself that should support visual adjustments, but the reading system itself</span><br>
<span id=de1d>… if content can be altered from fxl, do we need a metadata flag to say it is possible?</span></p>
<p id=9d8b class="phone s03"><cite>George:</cite> it has to be a combination of the RS and the publisher<br>
<span id=0706>… we should be able to tell people that they could have a pretty good reading experience with this</span><br>

<span id=d6ff>… for dispaly guide we focused on the publication itself</span><br>
<span id=0698>… we would probably be looking for accessibility sufficient plus reading order</span><br>
<span id=9ec9>… and we could provide a mode that allowed visual adjustment</span></p>
<p id=9245 class="phone s14"><cite>gautierchomel:</cite> the way we get to the reflowing feature<br>
<span id=0e80>… we should specify the alternative rendering, a visual way of providing a non-visual experience</span><br>

<span id=b4c8>… we know some people are looking for fxl content</span><br>

<p id=3b90 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> it depends on which CSS you use</p>
<p id=f5b7 class="phone s07"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> I have an example to test for that<br>
<span id=8a9f>… it works with screen readers, but you don't always have the TTS feature</span></p>
