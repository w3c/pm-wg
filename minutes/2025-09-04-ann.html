<p id=6fe4 class=irc><cite>&lt;LaurentLM&gt;</cite> Use Cases and Requirements: <a href="https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/wg-notes/annotations-ucr/">https://<wbr>w3c.github.io/<wbr>epub-specs/<wbr>wg-notes/<wbr>annotations-ucr/</a></p>
<p id=86f9 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> welcoming Abe from Berkeley university, working with Zotero.</p>
<p id=92a6 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> We listed that we can annotate a text, an image and the part of an image</p>
<p id=3f12 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> shall we add video?</p>
<p id=5c5e class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> and audio?</p>
<p id=0679 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> that mean we have to tackle the time issue. I suggest to add audio only because video players will be more complex to get into to extract an exact position.</p>
<p id=e079 class="phone s03"><cite>gautierchomel:</cite> I recently had an interaction on Vimeo where I added comment<br>
<span id=621c>… The interface made it easy to annotate a timestamp in the video</span><br>
<span id=ae74>… But I agree let us stick  with audio only</span></p>
<p id=8530 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> the part of an image is interesting. Complex to do for developpers because that mean we have to draw.</p>
<p id=557e class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> formatting annotations sounds a wish from users. Not sure how wide it is implemented yet.</p>
<p id=7230 class="phone s04"><cite>ajellinek:</cite> we support that in zotero, we store annotations as HTML. standardising that across editor may be tricky. Not all editors accept HTML. Often we see subsets.</p>
<p id=091e class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> maybe the note part can have a `content type` like HTML, MarkDown or PlainText, to drive the industry while letting space for flexibility.</p>
<p id=71b3 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> there are annotations and also bookmarks that need to be interoperable. That's part of the use case document too.</p>
<p id=cc02 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> a general remark, what can be annotated, what can be bookmark? Can i annotate an annotation, a footnote? are there limitations to consider?</p>
<p id=f288 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> this is not tracked yet. what does the group think about this?</p>
<p id=ffff class="phone s03"><cite>gautierchomel:</cite> I think it is useful, but recognize it may add complexity<br>
<span id=7fe1>… there is a use case for annotating other annotations and footnotes</span></p>
<p id=0a44 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> footnote can come with difficulties to locate if they are outside the HTML.</p>
<p id=4e7a class="phone s04"><cite>ajellinek:</cite> we don't support annotating annotations,</p>
<p id=238a class="phone s04"><cite>ajellinek:</cite> but it is a reasonable use case</p>
<p id=1978 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> it is also related to where the annotation is stored. When coming to technical, we may not be able to implement.</p>
<p id=8267 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> i see a way if we consider it a thread of annotations instead of annotating annotations.</p>
<p id=e39f class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> it's different, there are use case where i want to select a part of an annotation to annotate.</p>
<p id=169e class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> exporting &amp; importing is a big part too. We have different scenarios here, from publishing a book with annotations to users sharing annotations, including in a classroom context.</p>
<p id=dd19 class="phone s05"><cite>DaleRogers:</cite> in the past authors responded books by publishing a new book, an article or a document. This technology may bring new use case as responding to an ebook with an annotation.</p>
<p id=8941 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> the use case I see is more in scholar or academic context, in a teacher to student relation or researcher communities.</p>
<p id=efa1 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> the implication of considering those use case is that we'll study how to standardise. We've hear about a known US author who sells annotated book and did that with popup because there was not standardised way.</p>
<p id=4ef5 class="phone s03"><cite>gautierchomel:</cite> For annotation in social media, sharing annotations in a social media context</p>
<p id=c219 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> I am an end user for this?</p>
<p id=e2e5 class="phone s03"><cite>gautierchomel:</cite> Yes, I am in a book club, and I am sharing with other people in the club<br>
<span id=1f6a>… I could try to monetize that and sell annotations at 1 euro per book</span></p>
<p id=7ebe class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> Can you write the text for that?</p>
<p id=31ce class=irc><cite>&lt;ivan&gt;</cite> +1 to gautierchomel</p>
<p id=8956 class="phone s03"><cite>gautierchomel:</cite> yes, I will do that</p>
<p id=bf8b class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> section 5 is about synchronizing.</p>
<p id=c87a class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> that mean among devices, among readers, among versions of ebooks.</p>
<p id=13d6 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> I annotate the book i purchased, if i share with another person, they probably want to make sure they can differentiate the'y're annotations from mine. Identification is a use case to add here.</p>
<p id=2e03 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> among device is easy, it means I stand in my ecosytem, identification is easy. While sharing among users comes with identification complexities.</p>
<p id=97c2 class="phone s05"><cite>DaleRogers:</cite> i see it similar to customer support id tickets.</p>
<p id=c499 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> unique identifier to ebooks is not sufficiently used</p>
<p id=10000 class="phone s03"><cite>gautierchomel:</cite> Among device could also be among vendors<br>
<span id=d1c5>… so I read from one vendor, added annotations, now I want to use a new app</span><br>
<span id=1113>… so I have changed the ecosystem, and I should be able to do that</span></p>
<p id=4056 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> So I can move annotations between reading systems</p>
<p id=207b class="phone s03"><cite>gautierchomel:</cite> I am not comfortable with the distinction between sections 4 &amp; 5</p>
<p id=bfed class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> The big difference is the protocol<br>
<span id=1bd1>… In the first, it is just files, in the second there has to be some sort of protocol</span></p>
<p id=db52 class="phone s03"><cite>gautierchomel:</cite> But many use case are in both<br>
<span id=701e>… So for a publisher providing them, they could be by file or protocol</span></p>
<p id=033a class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> back to the identification part, 5.1 is my ebook; 5.2 is other people ebooks. I have to refer to the book instead of my ebook.</p>
<p id=caf4 class="phone s03"><cite>gautierchomel:</cite> I think it lives in both</p>
<p id=ae4a class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> it's true but use cases are to make sure we do not forget anything. Then file sharing and protocol may be used for all use cases.</p>
<p id=b344 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> last point is how to make sure we survive versions. It's a real burden here.</p>
<p id=de2b class="phone s04"><cite>ajellinek:</cite> we met the problem and still looking how to solve it.</p>
<p id=a1ed class=irc><cite>&lt;LaurentLM&gt;</cite> Requirements for locators  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/2763">w3c/<wbr>epub-specs#2763</a></p>
<p id=8218 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> with the additions discussed today, I think we can start the requirement. An issue is open.</p>
<p id=4a98 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> we have no more time to discuss that today, I invite you to check and comment the issue.</p>
