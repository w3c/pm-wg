<h3 id=t01>Publishing the FXL A11y WG Draft Note</h3>
<p id=x036 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> there's been a join task force between PMWG and Publishing CG<br>
<span id=x037>… with the focus to produce guidelines to make FXL ebooks more accessible</span><br>
<span id=x038>… the question today is to make the note published as a draft note, to get a broader review</span><br>
<span id=x039>… this document is a practice and recomandations document</span><br>
<span id=x040>… it will have a techniques document where we'll list how to achieve the goals proposed</span></p>
<p id=x042 class="phone s03"><cite>George:</cite> before we approve this (6 month from now), do we aspect to have authoring tools or publishers or reading systems that will support it?</p>
<p id=x044 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> because it's a note it doesn't require the process of the rec, so is not required to have implementations<br>
<span id=x045>… at the same time we based our suggestions from real life ebooks and tools</span></p>
<p id=x046 class="phone s03"><cite>George:</cite> do we want to test it?</p>
<p id=x047 class=irc><cite>&lt;AvneeshSingh&gt;</cite> It would be helpful to know what draft note mean. Does it mean that structure of note is freezed, or is it a more mature version of editor's draft, and structure can be revisited?</p>
<p id=x048 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> it's not mandatory, but may help</p>
<p id=x052 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> it's a more mature version of an editors' draft<br>
<span id=x053>… having it published as TR we'll make it more visible</span></p>
<p id=x054 class="phone s04"><cite>ivan:</cite> the difference between a draft note and a note is more on the naming, then on the content or the stability of the document</p>
<p id=x058 class="phone s05"><cite>Dale0:</cite> I asked big retailers specs about FXL, they sent me links both to new and old version of EPUB</p>
<p id=x060 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> Yes, I know that documents, reading systems normally try to support all versions of EPUBs</p>
<p id=x064 class="phone s06"><cite>gpellegrino:</cite> Two questions, before publishing as a draft note, do we want a short period of review for this group?<br>
<span id=x065>… one of the last notes about accessibility exemptions, we requested an OK from APA, since we speak about Accessibility, do we need to ask them to review?</span></p>
<p id=x072 class="phone s04"><cite>ivan:</cite> to the second question, we have no requirements to ask for an horizontal review<br>
<span id=x073>… I'm comfortable in publishing it now as a draft note</span><br>
<span id=x074>… as an aside I asked Kevin and Shawn to ask them a review</span></p>
<p id=x083 class="phone s07"><cite>AvneeshSingh:</cite> APA review may not be important for a process point of view, but maybe before the official release may be good to ask them a review<br>
<span id=x084>… maybe we can ask also to the AG WG</span><br>
<span id=x085>… since WCAG are involved</span><br>
<span id=x086>… for the time to review I suggest 2-3 weeks for internal review</span></p>
<p id=x087 class="phone s08"><cite>tzviya:</cite> I think that publish the draft note doesn't impede us from update it later</p>
<p id=x092 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> is there any concern in publish it?<br>
<span id=x093>… I think it's ok to publish it in draft note status</span></p>
<p id=x096 class="phone s04"><cite>ivan:</cite> I understand the reactions, but I would prefer to publish the note to make it known by the world<br>
<span id=x097>… the document is under discussion from fairly long time, so I think it is the right time now</span></p>
<p id=x102 class="phone s07"><cite>AvneeshSingh:</cite> two things, I think we should ask APA before publish it as &quot;official&quot; note<br>
<span id=x103>… I think an internal review should be useful, having the notice about it 10 days ago would be great</span><br>
<span id=x104>… it's ok that for the task force the document is fine</span></p>
<p id=x105 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> we ave a publishing moratorium next week, but we may move it to the end of the month</p>
<p id=x108 class="phone s09"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> I agree to publish it as a draft note, so it's more easy to have feedback from DAISY Japan</p>
<p id=x110 class="phone s04"><cite>ivan:</cite> I propose to do something in the middle, I propose to vote via email for publishing the note<br>
<span id=x111>… everybody in two weeks reviews the note and in two weeks we take the decision about publishing it</span></p>
<p id=x114 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> I agree I can send it at the end of the meeting<br>
<span id=x115>… asking for review</span></p>
<p id=x117 class="phone s06"><cite>gpellegrino:</cite> In the meantime, we still have the monday meetings of the TF, we can meet there and discuss there, we don't need the WG call to discuss</p>

<h3 id=t02>Webtoons discussion cont.</h3>
<p id=x122 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> we would like to find some kind of consensus</p>
<p id=x125 class="phone s04"><cite>ivan:</cite> on the GitHub comments Hadrien proposed a possible solution, but it requires to add a new normative feature in the spec, and we are not allowed by the charter<br>
<span id=x126>… I propose to put this charter question aside and we try to find the best solution based on consensus</span><br>
<span id=x127>… at the end if the best solution requires to change the charter we can work on it</span></p>
<p id=x131 class="phone s09"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> the Japanese community doesn't want a new feature for publishing webtoons<br>
<span id=x132>… but if most people in the group want it, I'm not against it</span></p>
<p id=x135 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> I think one problem here is that we don't have enough knowledge about webtoons outside Japan</p>
<p id=x140 class="phone s08"><cite>tzviya:</cite> we had a long discussion, we said that the user may select the preferred way to read ebooks (scroll o paginated)<br>
<span id=x141>… the webtoons that are being printed are paginated</span></p>
<p id=x148 class="phone s10"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> for that content what you don't want to do is to have a page with a little content in the middle<br>
<span id=x149>… the problem is how to move forward and backward</span><br>
<span id=x150>… in a smartphone does the content have to fit the width?</span><br>
<span id=x151>… using reflow or FXL doesn't matter, they both don't work in this way</span></p>
<p id=x159 class="phone s11"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> tzviya said that is not about reading systems capabilities, it's about semantics<br>
<span id=x160>… in pre-paginated we speak about pages, and a viewport</span><br>
<span id=x161>… in webtoons we speak about tiles, each with different dimensions</span><br>
<span id=x162>… those are two different things</span><br>
<span id=x163>… if we want to use EPUB for webtoons (it's fine), but we need another approach</span><br>
<span id=x164>… if we use FXL a reading system will display tiles in &quot;pages&quot;, with edges</span><br>
<span id=x165>… so I think we cannot use the pre-paginated world for webtoons</span></p>
<p id=x169 class="phone s09"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> it depends: rendition-flow: scroll-continuos is for us a sign to say that the EPUB is a webtoons<br>
<span id=x170>… because we don't have another value to express it</span></p>
<p id=x174 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> a lot of these are coming down to implementations and reading systems<br>
<span id=x175>… however a lot of these will come down to user preferences and how they prefer to read content</span><br>
<span id=x176>… I can read with scroll both for reflowable content and FXL</span></p>
<p id=x177 class=irc><cite>&lt;tzviya&gt;</cite> +1 to wendyreid</p>
<p id=x179 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> we just want to give the content creator the ability to signal that scroll is the preferred way to consume that content</p>
<p id=x191 class="phone s10"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> I'm trying to list requirements at high level:<br>
<span id=x192>… you want to have content that fits the full with of the viewport</span><br>
<span id=x193>… you want to list tiles on attached to the other (without borders)</span><br>
<span id=x194>… you want to access the whole content by scrolling it</span><br>
<span id=x195>… for this I think that the pre-paginated UX is not the good one</span><br>
<span id=x196>… an additional thing is how to deal with series and collections</span><br>
<span id=x197>… reflowable is all on the power of the user</span><br>
<span id=x198>… FXL is based on control by the content creator and as the assumption that you see the whole &quot;page&quot; in the viewport when you load it</span><br>
<span id=x199>… I think the UX would be much better if there is something specific, then using the FXL</span></p>
<p id=x200 class="phone s04"><cite>ivan:</cite> the current disagreement is that some publishers are using a undefined combination of proprierties to signal that a content is a webtoon</p>
<p id=x201 class=irc><cite>&lt;LaurentLM&gt;</cite> +1 to Ivan, that is right</p>
<p id=x203 class=irc><cite>&lt;Hadrien&gt;</cite> +1 to Ivan, that's a good summary</p>
<p id=x204 class="phone s04"><cite>ivan:</cite> what Hadrien says is to create a new value to express clearly what publishers want</p>
<p id=x207 class="phone s08"><cite>tzviya:</cite> I think we are discussing all the same thing in these meetings; we have publishers already doing it, we have to help them.</p>
<p id=x211 class="phone s09"><cite>shiestyle:</cite> I think we don't need a new feature, we are already using it, changing the old content may be challenging</p>
<p id=x213 class=irc><cite>&lt;Zakim&gt;</cite> ivan, you wanted to react to shiestyle</p>
<p id=x217 class="phone s04"><cite>ivan:</cite> the way I understand it, is not to add requirements for new features in the reading system, but to better express the content nature</p>
<p id=x221 class="phone s11"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> I understand that in Japan the prototype was developed and coming to the standard body, and here the discussion is happening<br>
<span id=x222>… is good to have the prototype, now let's find a good way to express it</span></p>
<p id=x228 class="phone s01"><cite>wendyreid:</cite> maybe we can do this iteratively<br>
<span id=x229>… we have also to think about expanding EPUB</span><br>
<span id=x230>… but this is only part of the solution</span><br>
<span id=x231>… right now it may be a little bit rough, but with better metadata, and OPF organization and etc. we can improve the UX</span></p>
<p id=x233 class="phone s10"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> in reflowable is the user that decides how to read the content, we have seen few EPUBs using rendition-flow in the wild, and fewer reading systems supporting it<br>
<span id=x234>… I think that extending something that is poorly implemented in reflow is not a good idea to expand it to FXL</span></p>
