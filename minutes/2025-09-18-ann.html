<section><p id=3bab class=irc><cite>&lt;LaurentLM&gt;</cite> <a href="https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/wg-notes/annotations-ucr/">https://<wbr>w3c.github.io/<wbr>epub-specs/<wbr>wg-notes/<wbr>annotations-ucr/</a></p>
<p id=fcbc class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> Updated annotation use case document with new use cases for audio and threads<br>
<span id=732f>… nothing about annotating annotations themselves yet, no consensus</span><br>
<span id=e55a>… can we move on now and focus on requirements ?</span><br>
<span id=cff4>… no comment, so let's focus on requirements</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=5e2d>Requirements</h3>
<p id=0d60 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> First list of requirements for annotation types</p>
<p id=7e3c class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> these are not annotation types, they're locators</p>
<p id=e4ae class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> agree, let's rename them to locator types</p>
<p id=9e0f class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> Annotation formatting covers rich text and tags (keywords)</p>
<p id=79e5 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> They're different</p>
<p id=947d class="phone s03"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> We're missing progression in a resource as a locator type, this is needed for bookmarks, we can't use text selection for that<br>
<span id=5a03>… bookmarking is an intent, shouldn't be its own section</span></p>
<p id=ac86 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> it's a looser way to point into a resource, using a %</p>
<p id=bf2e class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> the term &quot;progression&quot; doesn't feel like the right fit</p>
<p id=4e18 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> Annotation is the overall term, and then we have highlights and bookmarks for annotation types</p>
<p id=6dee class="phone s03"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> what about citations ?</p>
<p id=7cd4 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> they're an export option for highlights, rather than an annotation type</p>
<p id=60e8 class="phone s04"><cite>gautierchomel:</cite> Bookmarks should not be restricted to reflowable content<br>
<span id=2290>… for locator types, a bookmark is a &quot;point&quot; whereas the other ones can be a &quot;range&quot;</span><br>
<span id=4d9c>… for annotation content we could have a lot more, including multimedia (sound, video, image)</span><br>
<span id=1d07>… there's a real-life use case for this, it's available in specialized reading systems</span></p>
<p id=017f class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> is there a consensus to allow audio notes?</p>
<p id=79e9 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> yes</p>
<p id=0a60 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> let's add audio notes and image notes<br>
<span id=bbde>… let's go back to support for notes on bookmarks, is this a good idea?</span></p>
<p id=c272 class="phone s05"><cite>Dale:</cite> Are we including bookmarks in annotations? This feels broader than what I would normally consider to be an &quot;annotation&quot;<br>
<span id=f534>… is an annotation anything that the user is adding?</span></p>
<p id=7b0c class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> yes it's anything that a user can add and exchange<br>
<span id=2cb4>… there's a broader meaning and a more specific one, we're working with the broader one</span><br>
<span id=65d9>… maybe we need to rename our work, but it could be a bit long if we list everything</span></p>
<p id=a0eb class="phone s05"><cite>Dale:</cite> is a note/annotation anything that people &quot;write&quot; then?</p>
<p id=f7d6 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> yes, and that even includes audio/images/video, not just what a user &quot;writes&quot;</p>
<p id=c805 class="phone s03"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> what about the last reading location in a publication?<br>
<span id=6372>… it's not something that you &quot;write&quot; but the user wants this info to be exchanged</span></p>
<p id=252e class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> I'm in favor of supporting this use case as well</p>
<p id=0bf6 class="phone s05"><cite>Dale:</cite> Where is this going to be? In an EPUB, outside an EPUB?<br>
<span id=1474>… I'm worried about a conflict if we use terms like &quot;bookmarks&quot; if the feature already exists</span></p>
<p id=3143 class="phone s03"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> we're talking about bookmarks in the same way, if I read on device A, I want to bring my bookmarks to device B<br>
<span id=cbb6>… conflicts are something we'll need to deal with, this is not specific to bookmarks</span></p>
<p id=8ce9 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> our goal is to allow RS to export what they're already doing<br>
<span id=b735>… they already have bookmarks, highlights and notes, we're looking at a way to serialize and exchange them</span><br>
<span id=9ff7>… we need names for these things</span></p>
<p id=7457 class="phone s05"><cite>Dale:</cite> it might not be a 1 to 1 equivalent to how things are named between our work and RS, but it should work anyway</p>
<p id=f893 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> we have to be careful, because we already have requirements that some RS do not support (yet?)<br>
<span id=db63>… I don't know any RS capable of image notes for example</span><br>
<span id=ebd5>… we have to be careful with our requirements, otherwise they won't be implemented</span></p>
<p id=a7a1 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> we're trying to have a full view of what's possible and then figure out what's implemented later for a v1</p>
<p id=71f3 class="phone s03"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> image notes are widely implemented because of stylus support and eTablets like ReMarkable for example<br>
<span id=6dd0>… they capture the &quot;view&quot; of what you're reading with handwritten notes on top of it as an image/bitmap</span></p>
<p id=5c6e class="phone s04"><cite>gautierchomel:</cite> I think there is a need to add notes to a bookmark</p>
<p id=ba28 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> have you seen it on any other RS than Thorium?<br>
<span id=a796>… is this supported in Zotero for example?</span></p>
<p id=18c2 class="phone s06"><cite>ajellinek:</cite> we don't have bookmarks at the moment</p>
<p id=92b5 class="phone s04"><cite>gautierchomel:</cite> this is supported in PDF reading systems</p>
<p id=969c class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> this is where the terminology doesn't work for me<br>
<span id=fa8e>… body might be different things, annotation types seems to be a combination instead of standing on its own</span><br>
<span id=5c1c>… the real question is what's the locator and content? We might not need annotation types at all</span></p>
<p id=be41 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> but we'll explicitly need to say that something is a bookmark</p>
<p id=d23f class="phone s04"><cite>gautierchomel:</cite> I prefer Hadrien's take on this, calling them intents instead of annotation types</p>
<p id=11b2 class="phone s06"><cite>ajellinek:</cite> I'm wondering how we're defining things, I don't like highlights here because in Zotero's terminology this is how we visually present text selection<br>
<span id=7bba>… for example we can have underline as well</span></p>
<p id=f125 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> we can review this another time, next call for example<br>
<span id=eef4>… let's cover export and import</span><br>
<span id=a3d9>… we need embedded support, exporting as standalone files and importing</span></p>
<p id=ccd6 class="phone s03"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> going back to bookmarks, just wanted to say that they're widely implemented in audiobook players as well<br>
<span id=48dd>… we've implied that this is mostly about &quot;books&quot; and text, but that's incorrect</span></p>
<p id=65f8 class="phone s05"><cite>Dale:</cite> When we talk about bookmarks, are we talking about a label for a given location?<br>
<span id=3898>… I'm not seeing bookmarks in locator types, don't we need something?</span></p>
<p id=3fae class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> a bookmark is more than a locator, it has additional properties: label, color etc.<br>
<span id=dd4b>… we've added a locator type that works well with them, just need to clarify this better</span><br>
<span id=ff57>… for now it's called &quot;progression&quot; here</span></p>
<p id=1902 class=irc><cite>&lt;ivan&gt;</cite> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#introduction">The Web Annotation Model introduction</a></p>
<p id=0878 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> it's worth going back to the Web Annotation Model, we've already discussed these separate concerns before</p>
