<h2>Meeting minutes</h2>
<section><p id=33fb class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> user requirements - use of &quot;locator&quot; its called in W3C it's called 'selector'<br>
<span id=385b>… fixed some renumbering. this is all I done in UCR.</span><br>
<span id=f8d9>… UCR document is sufficient to announce our profile to W3C annotations.</span></p>
<p id=5468 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> do we want to publish the Note?</p>
<p id=75de class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> not yet.<br>
<span id=264b>… in UCR we want to say which requirement is a must have.</span></p>
<p id=8e29 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> how do we write the profile, do we have help from Matt or not?  What help can we have for this writing.</p>
<p id=ebba class="phone s03"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> UCR: I have cold feet - last reading location, I understand the need but the work we are doing is not aligned with that one.  I think that is transient info.  I see interest in doing that but could see it done in other means.</p>
<p id=59d5 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> DAISY ODP in DAISY world is a last reading location its at the cataloged protocol.</p>
<p id=2017 class=irc><cite>&lt;Hadrien&gt;</cite> <a href="https://apidocs.bookshare.org/reference/index.html#_highlights">https://<wbr>apidocs.bookshare.org/<wbr>reference/<wbr>index.html#_highlights</a></p>
<p id=f60e class="phone s03"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> but Bookshare API does have this affordance.</p>
<p id=009b class=irc><cite>&lt;Hadrien&gt;</cite> <a href="https://apidocs.bookshare.org/reference/index.html#_bookmarks">https://<wbr>apidocs.bookshare.org/<wbr>reference/<wbr>index.html#_bookmarks</a></p>
<p id=be8f class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> we can ask the DAISY folks, Avneesh.</p>
<p id=f8c3 class=irc><cite>&lt;Hadrien&gt;</cite> <a href="https://apidocs.bookshare.org/reference/index.html#_reading_activity">https://<wbr>apidocs.bookshare.org/<wbr>reference/<wbr>index.html#_reading_activity</a></p>
<p id=71f9 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> Can we have help from Matt?</p>
<p id=658b class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> depends on what help?<br>
<span id=0a89>… Matt is potentially overloaded at this point and there may be ISO work for him to do as well.</span></p>
<p id=0f8a class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> Not worried about the pure writing of the spec per-say.<br>
<span id=8284>… the structure of the document is what is more concerning.</span><br>
<span id=1552>… we define the overall structure of the document.</span><br>
<span id=a74d>… the def. of the structure would be helpful to get.</span></p>
<p id=ef9a class="phone s04"><cite>Charles:</cite> Matt may have the boiler plate for this.</p>
<p id=1b1d class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> Its not really the boilerplate its more the structure of the document itself.</p>
<p id=0993 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> we do have other notes which can be used as a start.</p>
<p id=4089 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> do we have a W3C template which defines a template of a profile?</p>
<p id=05c1 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> not recently.<br>
<span id=8a74>… term &quot;profile&quot; is not a defined term, we can do what we want.  we should try to minimize the spec and try not to repeat things.</span></p>
<p id=3119 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> biggest part of the spec will be around 'selectors'</p>
<p id=c56f class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> overall structure is the same, these are the selectors we will use some will come from text others we will define locally.</p>
<p id=0ac9 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> this is why we will reuse the vocab of the original spec.<br>
<span id=980b>… # of entities annotation is a resource, its also a body, target and selector. So the vocab should be simple.</span><br>
<span id=83d9>… what constitutes our profile, its very wide when we speak about annotations spec the body of the annotation could be 0..n can have several bodies.</span><br>
<span id=2b4c>… annotation can have 1 to many targets.</span></p>
<p id=e613 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> one idea - follow the structure the annotation spec itself, in the annotation spec we talk about body etc. in our case its only 0 / 1. following the same structure of the toc level.  would help folks refer to the original spec.</p>
<p id=4800 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> map the spec to the use cases define some other terms, we speak about highlights, notes, etc. there is an easy mapping. if an annotation has no body this is a highlight or a bookmark.<br>
<span id=cc84>… if an annotation has 1 body then we can say its a note.</span><br>
<span id=b5e2>… we have sub terms for note, highlight and bookmark.</span><br>
<span id=eb1d>… the content of the body is a note. is a type of annotation.</span></p>
<p id=24b2 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> when we write it down is where we will determine if this structure will work or not.<br>
<span id=4a48>… What about JSON/LD encoding?</span></p>
<p id=4b3f class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> in a sense.<br>
<span id=06db>… the W3C spec JSON/LD can be very huge and w3c ann spec restricts/ subset.</span><br>
<span id=d394>… its really JSON lite.</span></p>
<p id=bb8f class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> in this case maybe we should add a schema.</p>
<p id=3b03 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> JSON schema would be good to add yes.<br>
<span id=2a9c>… something formal to add to the spec.</span></p>
<p id=3058 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> in theory any JSON can be represented in Schema.</p>
<p id=6f3d class="phone s03"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> I think you can do a broad schema for JSON/LD<br>
<span id=3872>… there are some reserve values.</span></p>
<p id=e324 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> the JSON schema can define this thing.  JSON Schema was a moving target it should be more stable.</p>
<p id=498e class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> we can talk about the structure of what we will have.  A header, body and target.<br>
<span id=ebea>… Header - w3c annotation header with the context</span><br>
<span id=a370>… its 1 context http...</span></p>
<p id=26a8 class=irc><cite>&lt;Hadrien&gt;</cite> +1 for simpler context AND JSON Schema for our work</p>
<p id=79fe class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> the context file in annotation spec is very complex.</p>
<p id=dc6f class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> iri there is a type there is a creator modifier and modified.<br>
<span id=b70d>… we can have a motivation in the header. one value is &quot;bookmarking&quot; should we define sub-types?  different sets?</span></p>
<p id=a14a class=irc><cite>&lt;Hadrien&gt;</cite> +1 for an enum of motivations in our spec and JSON Schema</p>
<p id=1f77 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> should we subtypes note, bookmark, highlight, maybe motivation types.<br>
<span id=4978>… w3c annotations no notion of notes / highlights.</span></p>
<p id=3055 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> if it makes it easier thats fine.</p>
<p id=2ca1 class="phone s03"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> an ENUM would be important and in JSON schema. dev. only read JSON schema.<br>
<span id=896b>… what is tuff, selecting text, highlighting it then bookmarking it. we may not be able to differentiate.</span><br>
<span id=1ec5>… small lists well documented.</span></p>
<p id=d8e8 class="phone s05"><cite>ajellinek:</cite> agree keep it small and let folks do what they want highlight / underlines<br>
<span id=9869>… I don't want separate motivations, in our models we will define which is which.</span></p>
<p id=c541 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> motivation can be used for this.</p>
<p id=369b class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> user has selected something but didn't add a note so its a simply annotations. the color highlight properties is a broad term and doesn't describe the visualization but describes the structure.</p>
<p id=935a class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> if we agree about the shape of the header, I can write something about that. then there is the target.<br>
<span id=c613>… multiformat target:URL, target:object with id, or source, many things in the target. choose if we want, but validated by schema. simple structure always a target or flexible object  or url, what properties should we keep?</span><br>
<span id=b91b>… Readium target can have source and some metadata defined elsewhere. defined as simple.</span><br>
<span id=5916>… item in the spine and selector is the annotation for the source.</span></p>
<p id=72ae class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> closed world having a URL does not make a lot of sense.</p>
<p id=1a7a class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> said in req. we may want to have the target of one annotation can be another annotation.<br>
<span id=5e25>… if we want to refer to another annotation we use the ID not source/selector</span></p>
<p id=91a0 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> how to define the URL is restricted to a URL to another annotations we don't want to allow a URL to my home page for example.<br>
<span id=bdcb>… we define annotations URL scheme for annotations themselves.</span></p>
<p id=c86a class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> UUID is used in Readium.<br>
<span id=2aa0>… 4 blocks with hyphen in the middle.</span><br>
<span id=16b4>… defining the selector will be a little tricky</span><br>
<span id=791c>… choose the formats of the text, might be HTML / markup if its not a text image video audio, we will need a URL which points to what?</span></p>
<p id=df9d class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> do we want version 1 to do that?</p>
<p id=1462 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> No.</p>
<p id=5f55 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> HTML fragments is doable. but an annotation to a video could be difficult.</p>
<p id=865e class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> overall structure we just need to know the pointer type.</p>
<p id=aa7f class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> EPUB if its a video then video must be part of the EPUB package.</p>
<p id=a84f class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> for audio annotations its my voice recorded as the annotation.<br>
<span id=41aa>… deaf I use sign language as the video annotation</span></p>
<p id=f581 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> that means adding a new file to the EPUB.</p>
<p id=f194 class="phone s05"><cite>ajellinek:</cite> it would be unlikely to add that in our system.<br>
<span id=5a57>… image annotations would be difficult.</span></p>
<p id=a520 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> we remove it from the use case?</p>
<p id=6211 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> use cases are OK.</p>
<p id=ffff class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> we don't remove from UC, but if the annotation is on the web and can b a URL.</p>
<p id=55a1 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> by talking a reader can conversion from audio to text the audio doesn't have to be stored potentially.</p>
<p id=c5a4 class="phone s03"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> there are ecosystems that specialize in that. kindle scribe. in their case working with image is the most natural thing. we are missing representation, but maybe they are not interested in interoperability.<br>
<span id=10b5>… there are an increasing # of those devices.</span></p>
<p id=93e6 class="phone s05"><cite>ajellinek:</cite> distinction image and drawing on a screen, we would like to allow for ink annotations - relation to the text, circle something positioning to reflow able content is not really possible. especially when screen size changes. vs. attaching a image, but ink annotations are much smaller.</p>
<p id=c338 class="phone s03"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> depends on how you store it, context fore reflowable depends on user settings font size spacing etc.<br>
<span id=df1e>… both the annotation and the text being annotated and stored together as an image.  this is one way to get it out of a specialized ecosystem.</span><br>
<span id=9906>… something to consider.</span></p>
<p id=9b7e class="phone s05"><cite>ajellinek:</cite> 1/2 solution we would like to show something you draw on the page, but when you resize things not sure how we would show something on the page in a seamless way. maybe as a popup.</p>
<p id=3096 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> didn't Edge do this before switching to chromium.</p>
<p id=228d class="phone s03"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> I know some of them doesn't do well with reflowable content for anchored annotations.</p>
<p id=2724 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> I can start writing something. maybe before TPAC.<br>
<span id=d39b>… maybe file structure.</span></p>
<p id=9553 class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> I won't be there. too late for me at that time.</p>
<p id=2486 class=summary>Brady will be around and Hadrien.</p>
<p id=588a class="phone s05"><cite>ajellinek:</cite> I hope to be there virtually.</p>
<p id=4012 class=summary>Charles will be remote hope to be there.</p>
<p id=10000 class="phone s01"><cite>LaurentLM:</cite> We will look at this and the w3c annotation spec during TPAC.</p>
<p id=332c class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> TF are freely managed by the WG.</p>
<p id=2da2 class="phone s03"><cite>Hadrien:</cite> if we feel we need a new TF we can create one.</p>
<p id=02cf class="phone s02"><cite>ivan:</cite> yes the Chairs will need to set that up.</p>
