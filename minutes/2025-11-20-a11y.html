<p id="35de" class="phone s01"><cite>AvneeshSingh:</cite> we had productive discussion with APA. They asked for an explainer. This is a link about what they call explainer. It is about defining the problem, testing existing solutions, explain why they do not work.  we should recommend solution.</p>
<p id="34ba" class="phone s02"><cite>gpellegrino:</cite> I feel it is about restructuring what we already have.  Let's try.</p>
<p id="0361" class="phone s02"><cite>gpellegrino:</cite> the proposal is similar to footnotes. The question is who have time to do this?</p>
<p id="16ae" class="phone s01"><cite>AvneeshSingh:</cite> we propose a solution for everyone, not only assistive technology users, this is important.</p>
<p id="546f" class="phone s03"><cite>George:</cite> they noticed it is important for the web, so not aria dupb scope. At least that's not our first proposal.</p>
<p id="ffff" class="phone s04"><cite>gautierchomel_:</cite> I would like to do this, as a way to appropriate this topic, I have been an observer ulitmately. I can do that next week. So we can discuss in the next meeting.</p>
<p id="dbd0" class="phone s01"><cite>AvneeshSingh:</cite> Where should this document sit, in PMWG repo? I'll ask chairs where the best we should have this document.</p>

<h3 id="c194">Other items which require attention of accessibility task force?</h3>

<p id="2cfe" class="phone s03"><cite>George:</cite> my big question is around fixed layout.</p>
<p id="642f2" class="phone s01"><cite>AvneeshSingh:</cite> I will connect and arrange a call with people who are in both FXL accessibility as well as in Accessibility task force and then we can figure out way forward.</p>
<p id="2c0b" class="phone s02"><cite>gpellegrino:</cite> TPAC discussions were mostly about images in spine, we decided not to change anything. i.e. not allowing image in spine without fallback. That's a statut quo. Hadrien will propose a best practice document about using images in spine with fallback. The other point is to start work in pcg a11y tf about comic books accessibility. really a research project.</p>
<p id="4285" class="summary"><a href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/discussions/2829">https://<wbr>github.com/<wbr>w3c/<wbr>epub-specs/<wbr>discussions/<wbr>2829</a></p>
<p id="5566" class="phone s04"><cite>gautierchomel_:</cite> to me a big topic is about presenting reflow aside of fixed. I conceptualise that as parallele contents. Not sure where this standardisation belong, I would like to see it addressed by the accessibility task force.</p>
<p id="d436" class="phone s01"><cite>AvneeshSingh:</cite> for comics, we should discuss it in the publishing community group task force. We need to collect examples and start thinking about it.</p>
<p id="5c80" class="phone s01"><cite>AvneeshSingh:</cite> we've eared about projects ongoing in scandinavia, france, japan, number of them done in relation with EDRLab.</p>
<p id="6425" class="phone s01"><cite>AvneeshSingh:</cite> about parallels contents, is it about SMIL?</p>
<p id="e0c5" class="phone s04"><cite>gautierchomel_:</cite> I see it wider, being able to consume one content in two forms in parrallel, there is syncronisation, but it should allow any content, video, audio, text, other version of a text, fxl, reflow, etc. An example is the poc done by Daniel for Japan, available in Thorium, a parrallel reading of Sign language video and text with highlights at the idea level, not word.</p>
<p id="c8f3" class="phone s01"><cite>AvneeshSingh:</cite> SMIL is outdated anyway, but replacing SMIL in existing structure of EPUB 3 does not make much sense. Better to focus on new way of synchronizing in new publishing format.</p>
<p id="e0c0" class="phone s02"><cite>gpellegrino:</cite> I see a need for fxl and reflow contents living aside. It is used by scholar publishers, but not standardised.</p>
<p id="ac76" class="phone s04"><cite>gautierchomel_:</cite> yes, there is a reality.  there are many use cases, one can wish to switch at document level, resource level, or consume both renditions side by side.</p>
