title: Survey on the Impact of Allowing HTML Syntax in EPUB
date: 2025-05-08
---

The Publishing Maintenance Working Group (PMWG) is exploring the possibility of allowing HTML as an alternative content document format in EPUB 3.4, alongside the existing XHTML format.

This initiative aims to address the diminishing use and maintenance of XHTML outside the publishing industry while leveraging HTML's status as a living standard. 

The proposal does not fundamentally alter EPUB's reliance on HTML5 but removes the restriction to XML syntax. This change could simplify workflows, reduce barriers to entry, and potentially broaden adoption across the ebook value chainâ€”from content creation to consumption.

PMWG is seeking your valuable feedback on the potential benefits, technical challenges, and implementation timelines associated with this change. Your insights will help shape the future of EPUB standards. 

Your responses will be kept anonymous but will be made public to ensure transparency. Providing some context about your tools and workflows will help us better understand and address your feedback.

**Question 1:** What challenges, if any, would your organization face in adding support for HTML syntax in your workflows? Please describe any technical, operational, or resource-related issues you foresee.
