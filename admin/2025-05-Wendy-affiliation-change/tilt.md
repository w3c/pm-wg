# Name

Wendy Reid

# Affiliations

Previous affiliation: Rakuten Kobo

New affiliation: Invited Expert

# Rational

Wendy has left Kobo; she has the authorization from her new employer to continue co-chairing the WG, and she is busy convincing them to join W3C; as an intermediate action she has been appointed as an IE.

# Anything else we should think before we (re-)appointment the individual? 

None.
