Subject: publication request for an FPWD for EPUB Annotations, and two related notes

Denis,

This is an official publication request for the publication of the following documents, all for the 24th of February, 2026.
They are all published by the Publishing Maintenance (PM) Working Group.

EPUB Annotations 1.0, WG First Public Working Draft
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/2026/WD-epub-anno-20260224/
    - short name: epub-anno
      The transition has been approved in:
      https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/775

EPUB Annotations Vocabulary 1.0, WG Draft Note
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/2026/DNOTE-epub-anno-vocab-20260224/
    - short name: epub-anno-vocab
    - The transition has been approved in:
      https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/776

EPUB Annotations Use Cases and Requirements, WG Note
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/2026/NOTE-epub-anno-ucr-20260224/
    - short name: epub-anno-ucr
    - The transition has been approved in:
      https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/777

All documents are already in place. They pass pubrules' check.

For the link checker:

There are a number of link errors that are due to the mutual references of the publications,
these will take care of themselves. Additionally:

- For the EPUB Annotations FPWD:

  - The report includes some link errors to github.io pointers. However, these links are an artefact of referring,
    from the spec, to issues, which are copied into the draft by respec. I do not expect those to be relevant
    to the publication (sometimes referring to outdated versions of the spec, like the ones linking to a preview).

- For the EPUB Annotations Vocabulary DNOTE:

  - There is a reference to missing links in /ns/epub-anno.jsonld: this will be a separate
    PR on /ns to establish this redirection link once the publications are done. It will refer to
    https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-anno-vocab/index.context.jsonld which is part of this publication.

  - A number of fragment links refer to https://www.w3.org/ns/oa. That URL is a reference to RDF files,
    in Turtle or in JSON-LD (with conneg), which have their own semantics for the fragment ID-s,
    probably not understood by the link checker.


Thanks!

Ivan
