Subject: Preliminary publication request for an FPWD for EPUB Annotations, and two related notes

Denis,

This is a preliminary publication request for the publication of the following documents,
all for the 24th of February, 2026. I have just submitted the three transition requests,
and I will send you a bona fide publication request as soon as I have the approvals.
They are all published by the Publishing Maintenance (PM) Working Group.

EPUB Annotations 1.0, WG First Public Working Draft
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/2026/WD-epub-anno-20260224/

EPUB Annotations Vocabulary 1.0, WG Draft Note
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/2026/DNOTE-epub-anno-vocab-20260224/

EPUB Annotations Use Cases and Requirements, WG Note
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/2026/NOTE-epub-anno-ucr-20260224/

All documents are already in place. The first two have passed pubrules' check, the third one
got hung up on an internal error with the pubrules. (It is a simple document, I do not
expect problems, though.)

For the link checker:

There are a number of link errors that are due to the mutual references of the publications,
these will take care of themselves. Additionally:

- For the EPUB Annotations FPWD:

  - The report includes some link errors to github.io pointers. However, these links are an artefact of referring,
    from the spec, to issues, which are copied into the draft by respec. I do not expect those to be relevant
    to the publication (sometimes referring to outdated versions of the spec, like the ones linking to a preview).

- For the EPUB Annotations Vocabulary DNOTE:

  - There is a reference to missing links in /ns/epub-anno.jsonld: this will be a separate
    PR on /ns to establish this redirection link once the publications are done. It will refer to
    https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-anno-vocab/index.context.jsonld which is part of this publication.

  - A number of fragment links refer to https://www.w3.org/ns/oa. That URL is a reference to RDF files,
    in Turtle or in JSON-LD (with conneg), which have their own semantics for the fragment ID-s,
    probably not understood by the link checker.

I hope this preliminary request helps in your own schedules…

Merci

Ivan
