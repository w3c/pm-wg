Subject: publication request for a new version of EPUB 3.3 Rec, and three EPUB 3.4 FPWD-s

Denis,

This is an official publication request for the publication of the following documents, all for the 27th of March, 2025. 
They are all published by the Publishing Maintenance (PM) Working Group.

EPUB 3.3 Recommendation
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-epub-33-20250327/
    - The transition is from the previous the version REC publication with proposed additions. 
      The final transition has been approved in:
      https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/699#issuecomment-2724714500

EPUB 3.4 First Public Working Draft
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/WD-epub-34-20250327/
    - The FPWD transition request, with the new short name, has been approved in:
      https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/700#issuecomment-2724720594

EPUB Reading Systems 3.4 First Public Working Draft
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/WD-epub-rs-34-20250327/
    - The FPWD transition request, with the new short name, has been approved in:
      https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/700#issuecomment-2724720594

EPUB Accessibility 1.1.1 First Public Working Draft
    - http://www.w3.org/TR/2025/WD-epub-a11y-111-20250327/
    - The FPWD transition request, with the new short name, has been approved in:
      https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/700#issuecomment-2724720594

All four documents are already in place. Note that the new FPWD represent new versions for the EPUB 3 family line,
namely EPUB 3.4.

Some additional comments on the publications:

- All four documents use the Copyright agreement that was set up jointly with IDPF. I believe there is
an admin file somewhere which lists the documents that use this copyright; the three FPWD-s should be added to 
it (otherwise we get complaints from the pubrules checker).

- The definition links from the Reading Systems 3.4 across to the EPUB 3.4 spec are not working (yet). 
That will fix itself automatically once we publish the FPWD-s and specref absorbs the new documents. 
I presume it is possible to publish the document this way as a FPWD.

- I was not sure what the usual approach is for a new version number vs. history. Ideally, the history for EPUB 3.4, ie, 
the epub-34 short name, should lead back to the epub-33 line. If so, the extra magic should be
added to the history headers using, e.g., `data-previous-shortname="epub-34"` to point back to the right place. 
As I was not sure whether that is the plan, I did not do the changes. I am happy to that if you give me a green light.

Thanks!

Ivan

P.S. Xueyuan, the AC mail and HPN draft will follow shortly
