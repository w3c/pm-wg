Subject: [Draft AC Announcement] EPUB 3.3 W3C Recommendation updated; new FPWD-s published

Dear Advisory Committee Representative,
[This announcement will be forwarded to W3C group chairs]

It is my pleasure to announce that the following W3C Recommendation has 
been updated:

    EPUB 3.3
    https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-epub-33-20250327/

EPUB® 3 defines a distribution and interchange format for digital publications
and documents. The EPUB format provides a means of representing, packaging, and
encoding structured and semantically enhanced web content — including HTML, 
CSS, SVG, and other resources — for distribution in a single-file container.
This specification defines the authoring requirements for EPUB publications
and represents the third major revision of the standard.

All Members who responded to the Last Call for Review of Proposed 
Corrections to the Recommendation [1] supported the publication of the 
document with the proposed corrections as a W3C Recommendation, with several 
reviewers indicating that they produce or expect to produce products that 
use this specification.

Furthermore, the Working Also published three First Public Working Drafts:

    EPUB 3.4
    https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/WD-epub-34-20250327/

    EPUB Reading Systems 3.4
    https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/WD-epub-rs-34-20250327/

    EPUB Accessibility 1.1.1
    http://www.w3.org/TR/2025/WD-epub-a11y-111-20250327/

These documents are the starting points for the next major version of the EPUB 3
family of Recommendations. This new version will add some new normative
features to the specifications, as chartered by the current charter of the
Publishing Maintenance Working Group[2].

Please join us in congratulating the W3C Publishing Maintenance Working Group [3] on 
this achievement.

This announcement follows section 5.7.2 of the W3C Process Document:
