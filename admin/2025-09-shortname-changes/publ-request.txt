Subject: publication request for two short name changes for the Publication Maintenance Working Group

Denis,

This is an official publication request for the publication of the following documents 
for the 2nd of October, 2025. They are published by the Publishing Maintenance 
(PM) Working Group.

Strictly speaking, these are not new document in our system, just a short name change for existing ones 

EPUB Accessibility Techniques 1.1.1 First Public Note
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/NOTE-epub-a11y-tech-12-20251002/
    - Previous document:
      - https://www.w3.org/standards/history/epub-a11y-tech-111/
    
EPUB 3 Accessibility 1.2
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/WD-epub-a11y-12-20251002/
    - Previous document:
      - https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/WD-epub-a11y-111-20250910/

The changes in the short names was decided by the WG on its meeting, see the resolution:

 https://w3c.github.io/pm-wg/minutes/2025-09-18.html#c0ad

The transition request, with the approval, is at:
 
 https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/745#issuecomment-3338878389

Both documents are already in place. 

Note that there are cross-references between the documents, using the short name, 
which are obviously wrong at this point. I presume we can ignore that; we plan to republish
the documents as soon as the new short names are properly added to specref.

Thanks!

Ivan
