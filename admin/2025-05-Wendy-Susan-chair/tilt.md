# Names

- [Wendy Reid](https://www.w3.org/users/102009/) to be re-appointed
- [Susan Neuhaus](https://www.w3.org/users/136220/) to be appointed

# Affiliations

- for Wendy Reid:
    - Previous affiliation: Rakuten Kobo
    - New affiliation: Invited Expert
- for Susan Neuhaus
    - Affiliation: Invited Expert

# Rational

- Wendy has left Kobo; she has the authorization from her new employer to continue co-chairing the WG, and she is busy working with them to join W3C; as an intermediate action she has been appointed as an IE.
- With the departure of Tzviya (who gave up her co-chair position when joining the team) we decided we need a third co-chair. Susan has been active for a while now to prepare herself to be co-chair and she feels she is ready now. Actually, she represents an important community: she designs EPUB Publications herself and has, therefore, unique knowledge in the WG where reading system developers dominate the group. She is self-employed (with her partner) so W3C membership is not really a (financial) option.

# Anything else we should think before we (re-)appointment the individual? 

None.
