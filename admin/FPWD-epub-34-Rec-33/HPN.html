Xueyuan,

<h2>Updated W3C Recommendation: EPUB 3.3</h2>

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/pm/">Publishing Maintenance Working Group</a> has just published an
    updated version of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/REC-epub-33-20250327/">EPUB 3.3 Recommendation</a>.
    EPUB® 3 defines a distribution and interchange format for digital publications
    and documents. The EPUB format provides a means of representing, packaging, and
    encoding structured and semantically enhanced web content — including HTML,
    CSS, SVG, and other resources — for distribution in a single-file container.
    This specification defines the authoring requirements for EPUB 3 publications
    and represents the third major revision of the standard.
    The update includes a number of minor changes, primarily to clarify some details on the
    conformance requirements of EPUB 3 documents.
</p>

<p>
    The Working Group has also published three First Public Working Drafts, namely
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/WD-epub-34-20250327/">EPUB 3.4</a>,
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/WD-epub-rs-34-20250327/">EPUB Reading Systems 3.4</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2025/WD-epub-a11y-111-20250327/">EPUB Accessibility 1.1.1</a>. These drafts
    will eventually evolve into the next major version of the EPUB 3 standard, namely EPUB 3.4;
    see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2025/02/pmwg-charter.html">Publishing Maintenance Working Group</a> charter
