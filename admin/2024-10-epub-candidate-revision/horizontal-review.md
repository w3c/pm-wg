EPUB 3.3 2024-20-27 Recommendation with Candidate Corrections

The Publishing Maintenance Working Group[1] has just published an updated version of the EPUB 3.3
Recommendation with Candidate Corrections:

The Working Group would ask for an official horizontal review concentrating on the candidate 
changes before going to the Proposed Corrections phase (which also involves an AC review).

The candidate changes, with a reference to the relevant issue discussions, are:

- https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/REC-epub-33-20241017/#change_1
- https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/REC-epub-33-20241017/#change_2

For information, the Working Group would like to issue a Proposed Corrections version 
before the end of the current year. We would appreciate it if your review would be done within
that timeframe.
