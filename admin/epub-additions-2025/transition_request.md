# Abstract

EPUB® 3 defines a distribution and interchange format for digital publications and documents. The EPUB format provides a means of representing, packaging, and encoding structured and semantically enhanced web content — including HTML, CSS, SVG, and other resources — for distribution in a single-file container.

This specification defines the authoring requirements for EPUB publications and represents the third major revision of the standard.

# Status

See https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sotd

# Link to group's decision to request the update

See https://w3c.github.io/pm-wg/minutes/2024-10-04.html#2984

(Note: the resolution goes for three documents, but only one, ie EPUB 3.3, had changes that required the official update process.)

# Formal Objections

None
