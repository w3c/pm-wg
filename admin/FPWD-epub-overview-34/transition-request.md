# Is it intended to be a W3C Statement?

No

# Note

These are re-publications with a new version and, therefore, new short names of existing WG Notes, namely https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-overview-33/ and https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-tech-11/. These notes closely follow the evolution of EPUB 3, whose current version has just been changed for 3.4 (and 1.1.1. for the A11y spec). Hence the need to republish them with new short names (and thereby freezing the previous versions).
