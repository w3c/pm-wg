Subject: publication request for two First Public WG Notes for the Publication Maintenance Working Group

Denis,

This is an official publication request for the publication of the following documents 
for the 17th of April, 2025. They are published by the Publishing Maintenance 
(PM) Working Group.

EPUB Accessibility Techniques 1.1.1 First Public Note
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/NOTE-epub-a11y-tech-111-20250417/
    - The First Note request, with the new short name, has been approved in:
      https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/706#issuecomment-2782657651

EPUB 3 Overview First Public Note
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/NOTE-epub-overview-34-20250409/
    - The First Note request, with the new short name, has been approved in:
      https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/706#issuecomment-2782657651


Both documents are already in place. Note that the new notes represent new versions, bound to 
the 3.4 version of the EPUB family line, to the notes with short names epub-a11y-tech-11 and 
NOTE-epub-overview-33, respectively.

Some additional comments on the publications:

- Both documents use the Copyright agreement that was set up jointly with IDPF. I believe there is
an admin file somewhere which lists the documents that use this copyright; the two Notes 
should be added to it (otherwise we get complaints from the pubrules checker).

- There is a reference from the second note (Overview) to the first (A11y techniques); this is flagged by the link checker. I presume we can ignore this; the next echidna publication of the overview will get
everything in order as soon as the documents have been added to specref.


Thanks!

Ivan

P.S. Xueyuan, I do not think we do a HPN and AC announcement for these; they are just new version
existing notes. Not really newsworthy. If I am mistaken then ping me and I will prepare the usual 
drafts.
